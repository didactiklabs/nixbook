# Live 10-band equalizer backend for illogical-impulse / end-4's pC fork,
# ported from ilyaMiro's Serpantinum shell.
#
# It writes a 32-band EasyEffects "Equalizer" preset (only 10 of the bands
# are user-editable, matching Serpantinum's slider layout) and loads it live
# through `easyeffects -l`.
#
# Usage:
#   equalizer.sh <state_dir> get
#   equalizer.sh <state_dir> set_band <1-10> <gainDb>
#   equalizer.sh <state_dir> set_preamp <gainDb>   (master gain, independent of the curve/preset)
#   equalizer.sh <state_dir> set_dim <0-0.85>      (blurred-art scrim darkness, UI-only, no apply needed)

#                                                     state into a scratch preset and loads that, never
#                                                     touching the real active preset's own file)
